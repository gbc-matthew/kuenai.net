<h3>3-Day Space Weather Forecast Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Issued Date</strong>: 2025 Feb 24 1230 UTC</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The latest three-day space weather forecast from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, covering February 24 to February 26, 2025, indicates relatively stable conditions with low geomagnetic activity, a moderate possibility of minor solar radiation storms, and potential radio blackouts due to solar activity.</p>
<h4>Findings &amp; Results</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geomagnetic Activity</strong>: </li>
<li>Highest observed Kp index in the past 24 hours was 3, with a projected peak of 3.33 over the next three days, remaining below significant storm levels.</li>
<li>
<p>No significant geomagnetic storms or solar wind features are anticipated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solar Radiation Activity</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>No solar radiation events reached hazardous levels in the past 24 hours.</li>
<li>
<p>There is a 25% chance of minor solar radiation storms (S1) occurring between February 24 and February 26.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Radio Blackouts</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>R3 level radio blackouts, categorized as strong, were recorded on February 23, 2025.</li>
<li>There is a 65% likelihood of minor to moderate radio blackouts (R1-R2), with a 25% probability of strong or greater (R3) events over the forecast period.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geomagnetic</strong>:</li>
<li>
<p>Expected low geomagnetic activity suggests minimal impact on satellites and power grids, allowing stable operations for GPS and other communication systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solar Radiation</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minor solar radiation levels pose little threat to astronauts or high-flying aircraft, but continued monitoring is advised due to the potential for radiation storm escalation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Radio Blackouts</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Potential radio blackouts could affect satellite communications and GPS reliability, necessitating preparedness measures, especially for aviation and maritime operations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kp Index</strong>: A measure of geomagnetic activity; values of 5 or more indicate storm conditions, while current values remain below this threshold.</li>
<li><strong>S1 - Solar Radiation Storm</strong>: Indicates minor levels of solar radiation, potentially impacting astronaut safety and satellite operations.</li>
<li><strong>R1-R2</strong>: Minor to moderate radio blackouts, can cause degradations in satellite communication and navigation signals.</li>
<li><strong>R3 or greater (Strong)</strong>: Significantly impacts radio communication, requiring disruption plans for affected technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This forecast indicates a generally calm space weather environment, thus not posing immediate threats to technology or infrastructure. However, stakeholders should remain vigilant for potential escalations in specified areas.</p>
