<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The U.S. Department of Commerce's NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center released a 3-day forecast for space weather conditions from February 2 to February 4, 2025. The forecast covers geomagnetic activity, solar radiation, and radio blackouts, providing assessments that activities will remain below significant storm threshold levels.</p>
<p><strong>Findings &amp; Results</strong>:
1. <strong>Geomagnetic Activity</strong>: The maximum observed Kp index was 4, and it is forecasted to reach up to 4.33 over the next three days, which remains below the threshold for G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storms.
2. <strong>Solar Radiation Activity</strong>: Current observations show levels below storm thresholds, with a 15% chance of minor solar radiation storms (S1) over the forecast period.
3. <strong>Radio Blackout Activity</strong>: There were reports of minor radio blackouts (R1 levels) within the past 24 hours, with a 55% chance of continued R1-R2 (Minor/Moderate) blackouts over the forecast period. There is a 15% likelihood of stronger (R3) blackouts due to active solar regions.</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>: The relatively low levels of geomagnetic and solar radiation activity suggest minimal impact on satellite operations, power grids, and communication systems over these few days. The likelihood of moderate radio blackouts indicates potential temporary disruptions for HF radio communications and GPS accuracy, but these impacts should remain manageable. Continuous monitoring is advised for any escalation in solar activity that could heighten space weather effects on technology-dependent systems.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong>:
- <strong>Kp index</strong>: A scale measuring geomagnetic activity; values beyond 5 (e.g., G1) indicate increased geomagnetic storms.
- <strong>S-scale storms</strong>: Measure of elevation in solar radiation affecting satellite and atmospheric levels; S1 indicates minor disturbances.
- <strong>R-scale for radio blackouts</strong>: R1-R5 levels indicate the impact on radio communications due to solar flares, with R1 being minor.</p>
