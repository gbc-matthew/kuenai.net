<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Solar activity was at moderate levels with notable activity from Region 3981, which produced an M3.0 flare. There were signs of increased sunspot activity in Region 3978. The solar wind was influenced by a coronal hole high-speed stream, and the geomagnetic field was generally quiet but influenced by solar wind conditions. </p>
<p><strong>Findings &amp; Results</strong>: The strongest solar flare recorded was an M3.0, accompanied by a Type II radio sweep, suggesting the potential for coronal mass ejections (CMEs). There was an observed halo CME from the Sun's farside. Electron flux was moderate, and proton levels remained low. Solar wind speeds were variable, peaking over 700 km/s and associated with a positive polarity coronal hole. Geomagnetic activity was generally calm, with some active periods due to the solar wind.</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>: These findings suggest a continued moderate level of solar activity, with a slight chance of more intense solar flares that could lead to minor radio blackouts. The interaction of CMEs and solar wind variations with Earth's magnetic field could result in geomagnetic disturbances, potentially affecting satellite operations and power grids. Monitoring these events can help in predicting space weather impacts on technological systems on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong>:
- <strong>Solar Flare</strong>: A sudden, strong increase in brightness in the Sun's atmosphere, which can impact radio communications.
- <strong>CME (Coronal Mass Ejection)</strong>: Large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sunâ€™s corona that can affect Earth's magnetic field when directed towards it.
- <strong>Type II Radio Sweep</strong>: A radio wave signature indicative of a shock wave often associated with a CME.
- <strong>Coronal Hole High-Speed Stream (CH HSS)</strong>: A stream of fast solar wind originating from coronal holes on the Sun, affecting space weather.
- <strong>Geomagnetic Field</strong>: The magnetic field surrounding Earth, which can be disturbed by solar activity, leading to events like geomagnetic storms.</p>
