<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center released an advisory covering space weather activity observed from January 20 to January 26, 2025, and provided an outlook for the following week, January 27 to February 2, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Findings &amp; Results</strong>: During the period of January 20-26, there were minor solar radiation storms classified as R1 by the NOAA scales, observed on three specific days: January 21, 22, and 24. These represent the only notable space weather events for the covered timeframe; no other significant space weather phenomena were recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>: The occurrence of R1 (Minor) solar radiation storms indicates low-level disturbances in solar activity, which can cause slight impacts on satellite operations and minor degradation of high-frequency radio signals at polar latitudes. However, the forecast for the upcoming week, January 27-February 2, suggests that significant space weather disturbances are not expected, implying stable conditions for satellite operations, communication systems, and related activities on Earth during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong>: 
- <strong>R1 Solar Radiation Storm</strong>: This is a classification by NOAA indicating a minor solar storm that can cause minor degradation of high-frequency radio communications at high latitudes and potential slight impacts on satellite operations. These storms are the lowest level on NOAA's scale for solar radiation storms.</p>
