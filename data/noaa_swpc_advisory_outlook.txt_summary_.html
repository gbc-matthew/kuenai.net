<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center issued a space weather advisory covering observations between January 20 and 26, 2025. During this period, R1 (Minor) solar radiation storms were recorded on January 21, 22, and 24. No other notable space weather events were observed. The outlook for the upcoming week (January 27 to February 2) indicates that no significant space weather activity is anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>Findings &amp; Results</strong>: The key finding for the week was the occurrence of R1 (Minor) solar radiation storms on three separate days. This level of storm is minor and typically has little to no impact on communications and satellite operations. </p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>: The absence of significant space weather, apart from the minor radiation storms, suggests a low risk for disruptions to satellite operations, communications, or power systems for the following week. Monitoring these minor solar events helps refine predictive models and improve preparedness for more intense space weather in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong>: 
- <strong>R1 (Minor) Solar Radiation Storm</strong>: A category of solar storm that can cause minor degradation of high-frequency communications and minor increases in radiation exposure at higher altitudes. Such storms rarely pose serious threats to space-based or ground-based systems.</p>
