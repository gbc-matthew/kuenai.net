<h3>Space Weather Advisory Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Issued Date</strong>: 2025 February 17, 01:30 UTC</p>
<p>The Space Weather Prediction Center, part of NOAA, has issued the Space Weather Advisory Outlook #25-7 with a summary for the period from February 10-16, including projections up to February 23.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Findings &amp; Results</h3>
<p><strong>Summary for February 10-16</strong>
- <strong>R1 (Minor) Radio Blackouts</strong>: These events were recorded on February 10-11 and February 13-14. R1 disturbances can cause small, short-lived disruptions in HF (high frequency) radio communication, mainly affecting the polar regions.
- <strong>G1 (Minor) Geomagnetic Storms</strong>: Observed on February 10 and from February 14-15. These were due to Coronal Hole High-Speed Streams (CH HSS). G1 storms can lead to minor impacts on power grids and possible minor impacts on satellite operations.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook for February 17-23</strong>
- No significant space weather storms or events are anticipated during this period.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Implications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication Systems</strong>: The R1 disturbances might have affected HF radio communications, primarily over the polar regions, which could impact aviation and marine navigation slightly. However, with no expected storms in the upcoming week, normal operations should resume.</li>
<li><strong>Power Systems and Satellite Operations</strong>: The G1 geomagnetic activity could have caused minor issues with power grids but is unlikely to have caused any lasting damage. Satellite operations might have experienced slight disturbances but are expected to operate normally in the following week.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>R1 (Minor) Radio Blackouts</strong>: These are the weakest type of radio blackouts detected by NOAA, often short-lived, and typically affecting HF communications in polar regions.</li>
<li><strong>G1 (Minor) Geomagnetic Storms</strong>: Considered minor levels of geomagnetic disturbances affecting power grid operations and satellite systems on a minimal scale.</li>
<li><strong>CH HSS (Coronal Hole High-Speed Stream)</strong>: These are fast-moving streams of solar wind emanating from the Sun's corona, often causing geomagnetic storms when interacting with Earth's magnetic field.</li>
</ul>
<p>This concise advisory serves both to inform the general public of the minor disturbances observed and to prepare for the lack of expected disturbances in the coming period.</p>
