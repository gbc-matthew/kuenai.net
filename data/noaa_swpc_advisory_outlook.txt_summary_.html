<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center released their Space Weather Advisory Outlook #25-4, providing an overview of space weather activities for January 20-26, 2025, and a forecast for January 27-February 2, 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Findings &amp; Results</strong>: During the past week, minor solar radiation storms, categorized as R1, were observed on January 21, 22, and 24. There were no other notable space weather events during this period.</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>: The R1 (Minor) solar radiation storms are relatively low impact on Earth, potentially causing minor disruptions to satellite operations without major consequences. With no significant space weather anticipated for the upcoming week, activities dependent on space weather conditions, such as satellite operations and communications, are unlikely to experience disturbances.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong>: 
- <strong>R1 Solar Radiation Storms</strong>: These are minor-level storms on the solar radiation storm scale, indicating limited impact on satellites and minimal risk to space and ground operations. 
- <strong>Space Weather</strong>: This term refers to variations in the space environment, primarily due to solar activity, which can impact technology and human activity on Earth and in space. </p>
<p>Overall, this period shows a stable space weather environment with no expected significant disruptions.</p>
